Welcome to my site, a place where I publish some of my work, personal projects and anything else that interests me. 

I am a creative and resourceful data engineer and software developer. Currently, I am the Director of Data Engineering and Analytics at the Taxi & Limousine Commission of the New York City. My work involves developing and automating big data processes, building and interacting with databases, creating apps and dashboards for TLC and public, as well as conducting high level research to empower impactful legislation in the area of city transportation. I am also a co-founder of [VeryCool Studio](http://www.verycool-studio.com/) - an app development, data analysis, and rapid prototyping company. In my spare time I work on data projects, repair motorcycles and make movies.
