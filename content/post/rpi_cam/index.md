## A Self Conscious Printer

Since it's the middle of the summer and I'm out and about, I don't get as much time to play with my new toys, too busy hiking and motorcycling. Finally got a chance to work on my 3d printer again. I though it best to set up some sort of home server that I could use to track my printer, send it jobs from elsewhere and generally control it remotely. 

A lot of people online were recommending Octopi or Astrobox as good options to run a server, but both required a raspberrypi 3 which I didn't have. What I did have lying around were some raspberry pi zeros so I figured I could make do with those. I decided to go with this lovely [model](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2251878).
